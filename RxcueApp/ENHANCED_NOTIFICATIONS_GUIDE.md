# Enhanced Medication Reminder System Guide

## Overview
The medication reminder system has been enhanced to provide persistent background notifications that continue until medication is marked as taken. This ensures you never miss a dose, even when the app is closed.

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Reminder
- When it's time for medication, you receive a notification
- The notification appears even when the app is closed
- You can tap the notification to open the app

### 2. Persistent Reminders (Every 5 Minutes)
- **If you don't mark medication as taken**, the system automatically continues to remind you every 5 minutes
- These persistent reminders continue indefinitely until you take action
- Each reminder appears as a new notification

### 3. When You Open the App from a Notification
You'll see a dialog with 4 options:

#### ✅ **Taken**
- Marks the medication as taken
- Stops all persistent reminders for this medication
- Schedules the next dose according to your prescription schedule
- Updates your medication history

#### ⏰ **Snooze (5 min)**
- Temporarily stops reminders for 5 minutes
- After 5 minutes, you'll get a new notification
- Useful if you need a few more minutes

#### 😴 **Snooze (15 min)**
- Temporarily stops reminders for 15 minutes
- After 15 minutes, you'll get a new notification
- Useful if you're busy and need more time

#### 🚫 **Turn Off**
- Completely stops all reminders for this medication
- Removes it from your active reminders list
- You'll need to manually re-enable it later

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

### Persistent Reminders Too Frequent

- You can always snooze or turn off if needed
- Mark medication as taken to stop persistent reminders

## Best Practices
